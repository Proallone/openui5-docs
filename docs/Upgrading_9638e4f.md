The following sections describe what you have to consider when upgrading to a new version of OpenUI5.

Before upgrading to a newer OpenUI5 version, you must generally first ensure that your development strictly follows the documented compatibility guidelines, such as:

-   [Compatibility Rules](Compatibility_Rules_91f0873.md)
-   [Use Only Public APIs](Use_Only_Public_APIs_b0d5fe2.md)
-   [Coding Issues to Avoid](Coding_Issues_to_Avoid_3877872.md)
-   [The Owner Component](The_Owner_Component_a7a3138.md)
-   For OpenUI5 applications based on SAP Fiori Elements: [Read Before Extending a Generated App](https://help.sap.com/viewer/3343ff76a027486c829f8aa5b0fde28f/DEV_SAPUI5_ABAP/en-US/d9c146a4e0f049108cf8231bfca5585b.html "Before you start creating an extension for your app, make sure you have read the information provided in this topic.") :arrow_upper_right:
