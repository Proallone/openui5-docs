### Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScipt that extends its capabilities by adding optional static types, which can help developers catch errors during the development process, enable better tooling and code refactoring, and improve code readability and maintainability.

OpenUI5 publishes type definition files describing all the OpenUI5 APIs and types.

### Developing Custom Controls in TypeScript

There is documentation and sample code in the “custom-controls” branch of the Hello World application which explains how custom controls can be implemented in TypeScript within UI5 applications. It makes use of a tool for generating TypeScript interfaces for the control API which has been released via npm in alpha state. There is also a sample project that demonstrates how flull-fledged control libraries can be developed in TypeScript.
