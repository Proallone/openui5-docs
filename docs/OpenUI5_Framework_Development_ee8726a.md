## OpenUI5 Framework Development

This UI5 Developer's Guide contains information relevant for the typical UI5 app developer. Information for framework developers is maintained on GitHub.

OpenUI5 content is developed in an environment based on Node.js. [UI5 Tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/) is used as development server and build tool.

If you are interested in OpenUI5 framework development, see the [GitHub OpenUI5 project](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/master/docs/developing.md), where you can find documentation on the initial setup, development workflow, and how tests are executed.
