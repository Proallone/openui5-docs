## sap.ui.mdc \(experimental\)

The `sap.ui.mdc` library contains composite, metadata-driven controls that assemble UI elements with predefined user experience and various functionalities. The controls can be used as a basis for scalable application development and can be implemented for use with any UI5 model or data protocol.

> ### Note:  
> The following sections only provide additional information for some of the controls. For a complete list of all controls and their documentation, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api) and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/controls). 

> ### Note:  
> The controls in this library support OData V2 and V4 and any OpenUI5 model.

### Overview

***

#### Smart Composite Controls

The `sap.ui.mdc` library aims at providing a predefined user experience through metadata-driven UI controls . The generic behavior of those controls is decoupled from the application- or protocol-specific requirements to ensure a flexible usage of those controls independent of the back-end technology. The well-known UI5 development concepts and enterprise-ready qualities are supported out of the box.

***

#### Extensibility of APIs

The controls are open for extension by implementable delegates and well-defined APIs for metadata in a unified format. They facilitate XML pre-processing and including as much network-request-dependent information in the XML view cache as possible to speed up the application startup.

### Architecture

***

#### Controls and Delegates

Each `sap.ui.mdc` control consists of a central control part and a delegate that implements the non-generic parts, such as protocol- and model- or application-specific requirements. The implemented delegate encapsulates network requests and the retrieval of cacheable information.

Controls and delegates can be extended from the base classes by the `sap.ui.mdc` adopter leveraging the predefined default behavior. Only with the delegate will you achieve a complete control offering with the advantages outlined initially.

***

#### Metadata APIs

As `sap.ui.mdc` controls are supposed to work metadata-driven, service-specific metadata is translated into `propertyInfo` objects. They can include basic information, such as a label for a `Field` control, but also more intricate information, such as the information if a table column supports sorting. The `propertyInfo` objects are provided by the application via the delegate but can also be provided on XML view level in order to be cached and hence speed up the initial rendering.

***

#### Built-in Performance Advantages

The application startup time benefits from the metadata APIs. The XML view cache can store the results of the delegateâ€™s metadata processing This behavior should result in a significantly improved performance and fewer requests to the back end, which makes applications cost-efficient.
