## sap.ui.mdc \(experimental\)

The `sap.ui.mdc` library contains composite, metadata-driven controls that assemble UI elements with predefined user experience and various functionalities. The controls can be used as a basis for scalable application development and can be implemented for use with any UI5 model or data protocol.

> ### Note:  
> The following sections only provide additional information for some of the controls. For a complete list of all controls and their documentation, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api) and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/controls). 

> ### Note:  
> The controls in this library support OData V2 and V4 and any OpenUI5 model.

### Smart Components

The sap.ui.mdc library aims at providing a predefined user experience through metadata-driven UI components. The generic behavior of those components is decoupled from the application- or protocol- specific requirements to ensure a flexible usage of those components independent of the back-end technology. The well-known UI5 development concepts and enterprise-ready qualities are supported out of the box.
