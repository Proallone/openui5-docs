## Only Use Active Features

In order to keep you apps future proof and up to date with the latest improvements, you shouldn't use artifacts \(such as features, APIs, themes, etc., than have been deprecated.

***

If an artifact, such as an API or a theme, is no longer developed, we mark it as deprecated. Usually, the deprecated artifact is replaced by a newer and better alternative.

You can usually still use deprecated artifacts for a while - they will remain part of the code line until they are removed. However: This is not recommended since you can't expect the artifact to be developed any further. In addition, any deprecated artifact can be removed from the code line entirely with one of the next OpenUI5 releases. This will potentially break your app.

> ### Remember:  
> If you want to make sure that your app is future proof and stays compatible with new versions of OpenUI5, make sure that you don't use deprecated artifacts.

APIs that have been flagged as deprecated can be found in the API Reference: [API Reference: `deprecated`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/deprecated). To find more information on the topic of deprecations check the related links section.
