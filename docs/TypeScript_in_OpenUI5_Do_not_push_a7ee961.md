### What is TypeScript

TypeScript is an open-source programming language. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, which means that all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code. TypeScript extends the capabilities of JavaScript by adding optional static types, which can help developers catch errors during the development process, enable better tooling and code refactoring, and improve code readability and maintainability.

When you write TypeScript code, the type information is scattered across the code. But you can also create separate type definition files for already existing JavaScript libraries. Such files have the extension `*.d.ts` and these are exactly what we are providing for OpenUI5.

### TypeScript in OpenUI5

OpenUI5 publishes type definition files describing all the OpenUI5 APIs and types. OpenUI5 type definitions are provided via npm under the name `@openui5/types` \(published directly by the OpenUI5 development team\) and `@types/openui5` \(maintained in the DefinitelyTyped infrastructure\). With the help of these definitions, the TypeScript tools can support writing OpenUI5 apps in TypeScript.
