## TypeScript in OpenUI5 \(Do not push\)

TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript that adds type information to the language. It helps developers catch errors early through type checking and by providing code assist in supporting code editors, for example through code completion and inline documentation.

The types can be seen as a complementary addition to improve your development experience and help you write applications in modern JavaScript. You may always remove them from your app again in case of any issues. Browsers canâ€™t execute TypeScript directly; it needs to be transpiled to JavaScript, which can then be executed as usual.

### Delivery of the OpenUI5 Type Information

When writing TypeScript code, the type information can be scattered across the code. But you can also create separate type definition files for existing JavaScript libraries. For OpenUI5, we provide separate definition files that describe the OpenUI5 APIs and types. With the help of these definitions, you can write OpenUI5 apps in TypeScript and enjoy all the benefits that come with it.

OpenUI5 type definitions are provided via npm under the name `@openui5/types` \(published directly by the OpenUI5 development team\) and `@types/openui5` \(maintained in the DefinitelyTyped infrastructure\).

Providing the type definitions as a separate package allows you to retain an older version of the types while upgrading the UI5 runtime, which is one of the options to mitigate incompatible changes of the types. For more information, see our [compatibility statement](TypeScript_in_OpenUI5_Do_not_push_a7ee961.md#loioa7ee9617bc794b6fad21e4df38e31128__section_CSTD).
