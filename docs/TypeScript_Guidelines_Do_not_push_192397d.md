## TypeScript Guidelines \(Do not push\)

Provides an overview how to develop OpenUI5 control libraries in TypeScript.

For general information on TypeScript, see [TypeScript in SAPUI5 (Do not push)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/96880755e4e64fcd96c12694f430fece/Internal/en-US/a7ee9617bc794b6fad21e4df38e31128.html "TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript that adds type information to the language. It helps developers catch errors early through type checking and by providing code assist in supporting code editors, for example through code completion and inline documentation.") :arrow_upper_right:.

### Developing Custom Controls in TypeScript

Check the [documentation](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/blob/custom-controls/README.md) and the sample code in the [custom-controls branch of the Hello World application](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/tree/custom-controls), which explains how you can implement custom controls in TypeScript within OpenUI5 applications. It makes use of a [tool for generating TypeScript interfaces for the control API](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-typescript/tree/main/packages/ts-interface-generator), which has been [released via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/ts-interface-generator) in alpha state. There is also a sample project that demonstrates how flull-fledged [control libraries can be developed in TypeScript](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-control-library).
